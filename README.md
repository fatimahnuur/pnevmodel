This is a model for checking pneumonia in chest X-ray images.                                                                                                         Deep Learning was very hard for me because I had never learned it before but i know a little about Machine Learning :)). My PC was too weak for Deep Learning, and each training process took at least an hour. So, I used Google Colabaratory  and tried to improve the model's accuracy above 80 %
Yes, I used ChatGPT (thank you, ChatGPT! ðŸ˜Š). While coding, I learned a little about Deep Learning.
